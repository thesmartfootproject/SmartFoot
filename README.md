# SMART Foot Project - Artificial Intelligence for Foot and Ankle Deformities

## Overview
The **SMART Foot Project** (Scalable Machine Learning Algorithm for Real-Time Diagnosis of Foot Deformities), sponsored by the **Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)**, is a pioneering initiative by the **FABER laboratory**. This project addresses the critical yet often overlooked issue of foot and ankle deformities, which can lead to chronic pain, impaired mobility, and diminished quality of life.

Foot deformities, whether congenital or acquired, can significantly impact gait, posture, and overall health. Individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes are particularly vulnerable, as even subtle deformities can exacerbate symptoms and complicate care. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent long-term complications, yet many cases go unnoticed by patients and general practitioners alike.

## Objectives
- **Develop a scalable machine learning algorithm** for real-time diagnosis and classification of foot deformities.
- **Create an annotated image database** to train and validate AI models.
- **Provide a quick, accessible, and reliable diagnostic tool** to aid clinicians in early identification of foot deformities.

### Annotated Image Database
A comprehensive and diverse database of foot images, annotated with detailed information about various deformities.

### Real-Time Processing
Scalable algorithms capable of providing instant diagnostic results for clinicians and patients.

### Accessible Solutions
Potential deployment as a **web-based application** or **mobile app**, ensuring accessibility for both medical professionals and the general public.

## Importance
- **Health Impact**: Foot deformities can lead to complications in the knees, hips, and spine if left untreated. Early diagnosis and intervention can prevent these issues.
- **Support for Chronic Conditions**: Patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions will benefit from timely and accurate identification of deformities, improving their quality of life and reducing healthcare burdens.
- **Technological Advancement**: This project showcases the potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare, making diagnostic processes more efficient and reliable.

## Outcomes
- Transform the way foot deformities are diagnosed by integrating AI into routine healthcare practices.
- Provide clinicians with a powerful tool for **early intervention** and **personalized care**.
- Contribute to the growing field of AI-driven medical diagnostics, setting a benchmark for future projects.
